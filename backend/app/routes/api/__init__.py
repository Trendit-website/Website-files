This package contains the API routes for the Trendit³ Flask application.

It includes routes for authentication, payments, items, item interactions, location, task, task performance, profile, referral, religions, stats, and banks.

A Flask blueprint named 'api' is created to group these routes, and it is registered under the '/api' URL prefix.
